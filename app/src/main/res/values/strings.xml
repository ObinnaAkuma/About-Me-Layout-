    <string name="bio">Hi, My name is Obinna.
    \n\nI love Android Development,
    \n\nThis is why I have decided to become an Android Developer.
    \nFor the past few months, I have been self learning Kotlin, the generally accepted programming
    language for Android development by Google and so far, it has been an amazing journey.
    \n\nI have a lot of projects in mind already I would love to put out there for the benefit of a
    good number of people using my acquired skills.
    \n\nI have also for the sake of consistency and achieving my goals, joined the 100DaysOfCode challenge on Twitter
    where I constantly update my daily progress on learning Kotlin and Android Development for the next 100 days
    currently on the 16th day.
    \n\nI will be adopting the project based learning process, where I will be building out different projects that cut across
    different learning concepts to further equip me for the Android development Job Market.\n\n</string>
